## 💻 Setup

### 🎒 Prep work
> if only want's to update a markdown,like profile README,skip step 1 and step 2.
1. Create a new public GitHub Gist (https://gist.github.com/)
1. Create a token with the `gist` scope and copy it. (https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
1. Create a Steam  API key. (https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
1. Find the steam ID (steamID64) of your account. (https://steamid.io)
1. For updating a markdown file，add comments to the place where you want to update in the markdown file.
   ```markdown
    <!-- steam-box start -->
    <!-- steam-box end -->
    
   ```


### 🚀 Project setup
1. Fork this repo
1. Edit the [environment variable](https://github.com/YouEclipse/steam-box/actions/runs/126970182/workflow#L17-L19) in `.github/workflows/schedule.yml`:

> For updating github profile README,you can follow [steam-box.yml](https://github.com/YouEclipse/YouEclipse/blob/master/.github/workflows/steam-box.yml) in [YouEclipse](https://github.com/YouEclipse/YouEclipse) to create a Action in your README repo.Remember it's unsafe to use token with **`repo`** scope for updating the repo, steam-box update the profile repo using git command in Github Action instead of using github API.

   - **GIST_ID:** The ID portion from your gist url: `https://gist.github.com/YouEclipse/`**`9bc7025496e478f439b9cd43eba989a4`**.

1. Go to the repo **Settings > Secrets**
1. Add the following environment variables:
   - **GH_TOKEN:** The GitHub token generated above.
   - **STEAM_API_KEY:** The steam API key you created above. 
   - **STEAM_ID:** The steam ID of your account. 
1. If you want to show specific games,put the ids in environmet variable **APP_ID**:
   - like `APP_ID=431960,730`
   - you can get the id of a game from the store url: `https://store.steampowered.com/app/`**730**`/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/`

## 🕵️ How it works
- Get your games playtime from [Steamwork Web API](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi) 
- Update Gist with Github API 
- Use Github Actions for updating Gist
